#	FACILITY: A yet another gateway
#
#	DESCRIPTION: A CMake toolchain file to build against the musl C library instead of the
#		glibc one - the case of OpenWrt, Alpine and of the most embedded rootfs images.
#
#		musl ships its own headers but NOT the kernel ones (linux/serial.h, asm/ioctls.h
#		and friends), so the kernel header directories are appended by -idirafter: this
#		way the musl headers always win and /usr/include is consulted only for what musl
#		does not provide. A plain -I would poison the build with the glibc headers.
#
#	USAGE:
#		$ cmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/musl.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
#
#		The dependencies (StarLet, libconfig) must be built for musl too and pointed at
#		by -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<musl prefix>.

#   Setting CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME turns the build into a "cross" one, so CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR is
#   no longer filled in automatically - and it goes into the revision banner of the program.
#   For a native musl build it is the processor of the host; for a real cross build the caller
#   passes -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=<arch>.
